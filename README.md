I recently participated in a CTF (Capture the Flag) competition consisting of three rounds. Although I didn't emerge as the winner, the experience was incredibly enjoyable and intriguing. I found the competition to be both funny and interesting. I am planning to participate in more CTF events in the future to further enhance my skills.
